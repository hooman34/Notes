    "Gradient descent is commonly used in ML and AI. Looking at the image below, we encounter from lectures that the gradient descent is a 'process of finding the most lowest point of the function'. While this is a very concise and accurate explanation of gradient descent, understanding it in a mathematical way would enable a deeper understanding.\n",

    "The gradient descent image above goes through a line until it reaches the 'bottom' of the function. This 'bottom' of the function is called 'minimum'. We want to reach the minimum because it will give us the best values for our problem. One of the common use of gradient is when we estimate the parameters of a ML or AI model. We want to find the paramaters that has the smalles loss value (closes to the actual observation).\n",
